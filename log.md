# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 15th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a bookmark app

**Thoughts:** I had some issues with ES6. Const didn't work on Chrome for some reason so i had to switch to ES5 and use var.

### Day 2: January 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Due to being away from home yesterday i was unable to do any coding. I spent an hour doing FreeCodeCamp basic algorithms today. 

**Thoughts:** I realized how much i am improving in terms of understanding what the problem is and how to aproach it, but i am still lacking when it comes to more complex solutions and JavaScript skills. Still a lot to work on.
